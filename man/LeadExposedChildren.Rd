\title{Blood Lead Levels from the
Treatment of Lead Exposed Children (TLC) Trial.}
\description{The Treatment of Lead-Exposed Children (TLC) trial was a placebo-controlled, randomized study of succimer (a chelating agent) in children with blood lead levels of 20-44 micrograms/dL. These data consist of four repeated measurements of blood lead levels obtained at baseline (or week 0), week 1, week 4, and week 6 on 100 children who were randomly assigned to chelation treatment with succimer or placebo.}
