\title{Compute Regression to the mean under bivariate \eqn{t}-distributions}
\usage{
RTM.T(
  data,
  df,
  theta,
  cutoff,
  truncation,
  conf.level = 0.95,
  tol = 1e-05,
  maxEval = 0,
  maxGrowIter = 120,
  growFactor = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric bivariate data in which the baseline measurement is above or below cutoff points.}

\item{df}{Vector giving the degree of freedoms of the variables}

\item{theta}{Numeric value of mixing angle}

\item{cutoff}{Numeric value shows from which the baseline measurement is above or below.}

\item{truncation}{character string, one of \code{"left"} or \code{"right"}
indicating the specification of the truncation. For left truncation distribution \code{"left"} refers to
that the true treatment effect and baseline measurements are below the cutoff point.}

\item{conf.level}{confidence level for the returned confidence interval,
restricted to lie between zero and one}

\item{tol}{Relative tolerance for numerical integration (smaller values give more precision but may increase computation time).}

\item{maxEval}{Maximum number of function evaluations for the numerical integrator (0 uses the integrator's default limit).}

\item{maxGrowIter}{Maximum number of iterations for the "growing-window" fallback integration when the main integration does not converge.}

\item{growFactor}{Multiplier controlling how quickly the integration window expands in the growing-window method.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{htest}, containing the following components:
\item{statistic}{the t-statistic, with names attribute \code{"t"}}
\item{p.value}{the p-value for the test}
\item{conf.int}{is a confidence
interval (vector of length 2) for the true  treatment mean. The
confidence level is recorded in the attribute \code{conf.level}}.
\item{estimate}{vector of length 2, giving the estimate of RTM and treatment effect.}
\item{null.value}{is the value of the treatment mean specified by the null hypothesis.}
\item{data.name}{a character string (vector of length 1) containing the actual names of the input vectors \code{data}}
}
\description{
This function is based on the truncated bivariate \eqn{t}-distributions and creates confidence intervals and tests hypotheses under
adjustment of regression to the mean.
}
\details{
The RTM effect is estimated from bivariate samples whose test statistics follows \eqn{t}-distributions truncated the baseline measurement
either \code{"left"} or \code{"right"}. The treatment effect is estimated and test under adjustment of RTM.
}
\section{Null Hypothesis}{
 The null hypothesis is
that the difference between baseline measurement and followup measurement of the population from which \code{data} is drawn is zero.
For the one-sample t-tests, the null hypothesis is that the
population mean for difference of pre and post measurement in \code{data} is equal to zero.

The alternative hypothesis in each case i.e \code{truncation="left"} or \code{truncation="right"} does not equal to zero.
