\usage{
RTM.Norm(data,
         mu,
         Sigma,
         delta = 0,
         cutoff,
         truncation,
         conf.level = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric bivariate data in which the baseline measurement is above or below cutoff points}

\item{mu}{A vector giving the means of the variables.}

\item{Sigma}{a positive-definite symmetric matrix specifying the covariance matrix of the variables.}

\item{delta}{a single number representing the value of the difference in means specified by the null hypothesis}

\item{cutoff}{Numeric value shows from which the baseline measurement is above or below.}

\item{truncation}{character string, one of \code{"left"} or \code{"right"}
indicating the specification of the truncation. For left truncation distribution \code{"left"} refers to
that the true treatment effect and baseline measurements are below the cutoff point.}

\item{conf.level}{confidence level for the returned confidence interval,
restricted to lie between zero and one}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{htest}, containing the following components:
\item{statistic}{the t-statistic, with names attribute \code{"t"}}
\item{p.value}{the p-value for the test}
\item{conf.int}{is a confidence interval (vector of length 2) for the true  treatment mean. The
confidence level is recorded in the attribute \code{conf.level}.}
\item{estimate}{vector of length 2, giving the estimate of RTM and treatment effect.}
\item{null.value}{is the value of the treatment mean specified by the null hypothesis.}
\item{data.name}{a character string (vector of length 1) containing the actual names of the input vectors \code{data}}
}
\description{
This function is based on the truncated bivariate Normal distributions and creates confidence intervals and tests hypotheses under
adjustment of regression to the mean
}
\details{
The RTM effect is estimated from bivariate samples drawn from Normal distribution in which the baseline measurement
is truncated either \code{"left"} or \code{"right"}. The treatment effect is estimated and test under adjustment of RTM proposed by Khan and Oliver (2022). The expression
of RTM for right truncation is. \deqn{{R_r}\left( {{x_0};\Sigma } \right) = \left( {{\sigma _1} - \rho {\sigma _2}} \right)\frac{{\phi \left( {{z_0}} \right)}}{{1 - \Phi \left( {{z_0}} \right)}}}
Where \eqn{z_o} shows the z-score of cutoff point, \eqn{\phi(z_0)} is the density, and \eqn{\Phi(z_o)} is the CDF of standard normal distribution.
}
\section{Null Hypothesis}{
 The null hypothesis is
that the difference between baseline measurement and followup measurement of the population from which \code{data} is drawn is equal to \code{delta}.
For the one-sample z-tests, the null hypothesis is that the
population mean for difference of pre and post measurement in \code{data} less that for \code{y} is \code{delta}.

The alternative hypothesis is that the mean of difference between pre and post measurement is not equal to \code{delta}

\examples{
library(RTM)
data("LeadExposedChildren")
  ### extract treatment group, baseline and followup measurement
treatGrp<- LeadExposedChildren[LeadExposedChildren$Group=="A",c(3,6)]
  ### cutoff point it is different for different studies
cutoff<-19.7
  ### define mean and variance covariance matrix
mu<-c(20.096,14.887)
varcov<-matrix(c(8.251^2,0.684*8.251*11.006,
              0.684*8.251*11.006,8.251^2),nrow = 2)
  ### estimate the RTM effect
RTM<-RTM.Norm(treatGrp,mu=mu,Sigma = varcov,cutoff = cutoff,
              truncation = "right")
RTM
  ### Total effect
mean(treatGrp[,1]-treatGrp[,2])
  ### treatment effect
RTM$estimate[2]
  ### RTM
RTM$estimate[1]
